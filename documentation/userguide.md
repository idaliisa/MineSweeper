### GUI:
Simulate the solver by running the [application](https://github.com/idaliisa/MineSweeper/releases/tag/firstRelease).
Alternatively run [JavaFXMineSweeper.java](https://github.com/idaliisa/MineSweeper/blob/master/MineSweeper/src/main/java/tira/minesweeper/main/JavaFXMineSweeper.java).

Click _New Game_ and _Simulate_ to run the solver. Solver may fail, and in this case you see _M_ (mine) in one of the squares. _F_ stands for flagged square. At the moment system doesn't notify whether game is failed or solved.

Alternatively you can play manually. _Left click_ opens the square and _right click_ flags the square.


### Performance tests:
Run [Main.java](https://github.com/idaliisa/MineSweeper/blob/master/MineSweeper/src/main/java/tira/minesweeper/main/Main.java).

Prints out percentage of solved and failed games and the execution time. Results are for easy, intermediate and expert level games. Level desciptions and test results are also [here](https://github.com/idaliisa/MineSweeper/blob/master/documentation/testing.md).
