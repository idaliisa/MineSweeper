### GUI:
Run JavaFXMineSweeper class.

Click _New Game_ and _Simulate_ to run the solver. Solver may fail, and in this case you see _M_ (mine) in one of the squares. _F_ stands for flagged square. At the moment system doesn't notify whether game is failed or solved.

Alternatively you can play manually. _Left click_ opens the square and _right click_ flags the square.


### Performance tests:
Run Main class.

Prints out percentage of solved and failed games and the execution time. At the moment 16x16 board with 40 mines and 1000 repetiotions are hardcoded to the system.
