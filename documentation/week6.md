# Week 6

## Progress this week

* added own implemetation to hashSet
* took own data structure implementations in use
* started performance tests

## Problems
I have a bug in performance tests. Percentage of solved games is way too high compared to literature references. 

## Next week
Own implementation to random, fix performance tests, junit tests, documentation and refactoring the code.
