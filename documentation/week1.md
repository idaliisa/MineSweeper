# Week 1 

## Progress this week

* Project creation
* Version control
* Project spesification (in progress)

Took time to decide what is the input and what to measure.
Considered first to autogenerate x number of templates. In that case would have measured temporal performance and the percentage of solvable templates by the algorithm.
Ended up having another approach i.e having prebuilt templates and measuring the time to get a solution. This is, allowing the algorithm learn from gameover.

## Uncertainties
Not sure yet about data structures and whether it is good idea to implement GaussianElimination algorithm.

## Next week
Complete the specification document and start coding.
