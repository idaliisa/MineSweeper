# Specification

This is to implement a minesweeper solver in java.

Idea is to try different approaches and aim for temporally efficient solution.

## Algorithms and Time complexity
Initial ideas for solver is from [here](https://luckytoilet.wordpress.com/2012/12/23/2125/). This algorithm solves the game with brute force and time complexity is 2^n.  In practise n is less since algorithm uses common blocks. Would also be possible to use matrices ([source](https://massaioli.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/solving-minesweeper-with-matricies/comment-page-1/)).

## Data structures and Space complexity
Squared ArrayList and ArrayList should be all advanced data structures needed and space complexity some multiply of n.

## Input
* Board is autogenerated after the first square is opened.

## Output
Console:
* Percentage of solved games
* Time to solve the game

GUI:
* Simulation
