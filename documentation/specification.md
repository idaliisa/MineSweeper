# Specification

This is to implement a minesweeper solver in java. (DONE)

Idea is to try different approaches and aim for temporally efficient solution. (ONLY ONE APPROACH DONE)

## Algorithms and Time complexity
Initial ideas for solver is from [here](https://luckytoilet.wordpress.com/2012/12/23/2125/). This algorithm solves the game with brute force and time complexity is 2^n.  In practise n is less since algorithm uses common blocks. Would also be possible to use matrices ([source](https://massaioli.wordpress.com/2013/01/12/solving-minesweeper-with-matricies/comment-page-1/)). (NOT FOLLOWED)

## Data structures and Space complexity
Squared ArrayList and ArrayList should be all advanced data structures needed and space complexity some multiply of n. (NOT FOLLOWED)

## Input
* Board is autogenerated after the first square is opened.(DOES NOT APPLY)

## Output (DONE)
Console:
* Percentage of solved games
* Time to solve the game

GUI:
* Simulation
