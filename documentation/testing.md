
## Unit test and manual testing
Solver has been tested manually. The solver works fine but it cannot always find the solution even if there would be one. Another algorithm implemetnation would solve higher number of games. 

## Performance testing for the solver

Initial tests for 16x16 board with 40 mines:


| Execution time per 1000 games |
|-------------------------------|
| 1010 ms                       |


I will add percentage of solved games later.
