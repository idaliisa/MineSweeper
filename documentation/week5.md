# Week 5

## Progress this week

* added solver

## Problems
I notice that my design document is badly out of the date. I need to decide what I'm going to test.

## Questions
Can I use Java's Random class or should I make my own implementation?

## Next week
Add own data structure implementations. Also the solver uses Stack and ArrayList now but I'm going to replace them with hashSet.
